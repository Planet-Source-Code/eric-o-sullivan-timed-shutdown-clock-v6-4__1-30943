'This module was made for using api graphics functions in your
'programs. With the following api calls and function and procedures
'written by me, you have to tools to do almost anything. The only api
'function listed here that is not directly used by any piece of code
'in this module is BitBlt. You have the tools to create and manipulate
'graphics, but it is still necessary to display them manually. The
'functions themselves mostly need hDc or a handle to work. You can
'find this hDc in both a forms and pictureboxs' properties. I have
'also set up a data type called BitmapStruc. For my programs, I have
'used this structure almost exclusivly for the graphics. The structure
'holds all the information needed to reference a bitmap created using
'this module (CreateNewBitmap, DeleteBitmap).
'Please keep in mind that any object (bitmap, brush, pen etc) needs to
'be deleted after use or else it will stay in memory until the program is
'finished. Not doing so will eventually cause your program to take up
'ALL your computers recources.
'
'Thank you,
